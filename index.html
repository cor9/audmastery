              Acting coach, talent manager, advocate for young performers
            </p>
            <p>
              Corey Ralston has spent over two decades guiding young actors in
              the TV & Film industry. Corey, himself, was a child actor since
              the age of seven in L.A.
            </p>
            <p>
              He then went on to pursue talent management in 2017, where he
              currently represents kids and young adults at Bohemia Group.
              Corey's mission is to help as many young actors achieve success as
              he possibly can.
            </p>
            <p>
              He founded the resource community Child Actor 101 for parents of
              youth actors, moderating discussions with a team of Industry
              Professionals, giving out frank free advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              His coaching blends professional insight from talent management
              with practical, kid-friendly techniques that help actors grow
              quickly and authentically.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parents and casting directors alike recognize Corey's coaching for
              its mix of strategic challenge and safe creative space. Breakthroughs
              aren't rare—they're expected. Many students have moved from
              uncertainty to callbacks, bookings, and real confidence under
              Corey's guidance.

                "I truly believe that your coaching has helped Aiden take his
